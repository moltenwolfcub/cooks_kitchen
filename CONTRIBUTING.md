## Code-Formatting

### Formatting system

* Please always indent using **tabs of 4 spaces**

* Please type 1 line of code per physical line.

### Code system

* Please don't use raw json data. When possible use data generation. [Good datagen video](https://youtu.be/rGURjv3jH7Y).

* Please **always** put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]).

* Please try your best to match formatting to existing stuff I have done. (Most likely you are an intelligent person and can figure it out for yourself)
